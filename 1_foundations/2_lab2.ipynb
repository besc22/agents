       "### Response to Urban Delivery Company’s Objectives \n",
       "\n",
       "**1) Quantitative Objective Function:**\n",
       "To effectively balance costs, emissions, and on-time deliveries, our objective function can be defined as:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Objective: Minimize Cost (C) + Emissions (E) + (1 - On-time Delivery Rate (ODR))**\n",
       "\n",
       "This can be mathematically represented as:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Minimize: C + E + (1 - ODR)**\n",
       "\n",
       "Where:\n",
       "- C = Total operational cost ($) over a 5-year horizon\n",
       "- E = Total emissions (CO2 equivalent tons) over the same period\n",
       "- ODR = On-time delivery rate (%) aimed to improve by 15% from the baseline in five years.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Measurable Objectives:**\n",
       "- Reduce operational costs by 20% ($X to $Y in 5 years).\n",
       "- Decrease emissions by 30% (from X tons CO2 to Y tons CO2).\n",
       "- Improve on-time delivery from X% to at least Y% over 5 years.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2) Strategic Options:**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Option 1: Fleet Electrification**\n",
       "- **Expected Benefits:** Reduction in fuel costs up to 40%; emissions cut by approximately 50%.\n",
       "- **Resource Requirements:** Investment in electric vehicles (EVs) (50 units at $60,000 each), charging infrastructure (estimated $500,000 installation).\n",
       "- **Key Risks:** Higher upfront costs and potential early-stage technology failures; dependency on local charging infrastructure.\n",
       "- **Costs:** Estimated total cost of $5 million over 5 years.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Option 2: Advanced Routing Algorithms**\n",
       "- **Expected Benefits:** On-time delivery improvements by 15-25%; fuel efficiency increase by 10%.\n",
       "- **Resource Requirements:** Software purchase ($100,000), training for staff, and potential ongoing service fees (about $20,000 annually).\n",
       "- **Key Risks:** Software integration issues, reliance on real-time data accuracy; potential temporary disruptions in original workflow.\n",
       "- **Costs:** Roughly $300,000 for initial investment and 5-year operational costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Option 3: Strategic Partnerships with Local Businesses**\n",
       "- **Expected Benefits:** Shared resources leading to operational cost savings of around 10%; improved density in delivery and potentially 20% boost in on-time deliveries.\n",
       "- **Resource Requirements:** Staff time for partnership development (~200 hours), marketing budget for collaboration (~$50,000).\n",
       "- **Key Risks:** Partner reliability and alignment; potential dilution of company values or service quality.\n",
       "- **Costs:** Estimated cost of $250,000 for 5 years for time and marketing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3) Decision Rule and Threshold Values:**\n",
       "Create a decision tree based on observable market indicators (fuel costs, infrastructure availability for EVs, routing inefficiencies, partnerships) that guide a switch in strategy.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Decision Tree Thresholds:**\n",
       "- If fuel costs rise by more than 10% beyond baseline, prioritize Fleet Electrification.\n",
       "- If on-time delivery drops more than 5% quarter-over-quarter, switch focus to Advanced Routing Algorithms.\n",
       "- If traffic congestion increases by 15% or more, use Strategic Partnerships for localized solutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4) Assumptions and Contingencies:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Assumption**: Fuel prices will remain stable.\n",
       "   - **False Scenario**: Shift budget towards hybrid or less fuel-dependent vehicles.\n",
       "  \n",
       "2. **Assumption**: Local infrastructure will support EV adoption.\n",
       "   - **False Scenario**: Implement more aggressive partnerships or retrain delivery staff for adaptability to hybrid vehicles.\n",
       "  \n",
       "3. **Assumption**: Technology adoption of routing systems will meet adaptations.\n",
       "   - **False Scenario**: Seek alternatives (manual methods, simpler software) until multiple options have been effectively tested.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Assumption**: Demand growth is predictable.\n",
       "   - **False Scenario**: Pivot towards developing flexible staffing models (increasing gig workforce) to handle variable demand.\n",
       "  \n",
       "5. **Assumption**: Partnerships can be reliably established with local businesses.\n",
       "   - **False Scenario**: Focus on internal capacity building to handle increased local deliveries independently.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5) Monitoring and Experiment Plan:**\n",
       "Conduct experimental pilots focusing on delivery times, costs, and emissions:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Pilot 1: Electronic Vehicle Fleet Pilot**\n",
       "  - **Metrics**: Delivery costs, emissions produced.\n",
       "  - **Sample Size**: 10% of deliveries (200 deliveries within one quarter).\n",
       "  - **Frequency**: Quarterly.\n",
       "  - **Stopping Criteria**: If emissions exceed 20% of forecast, stop the rollout.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Pilot 2: Routing Software Test**\n",
       "  - **Metrics**: Average delivery time, fuel consumption.\n",
       "  - **Sample Size**: 15% of routes analyzed (150 routes over 3 months).\n",
       "  - **Frequency**: Monthly review.\n",
       "  - **Stopping Criteria**: If no improvement after 2 consecutive reporting periods, revert to prior methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Pilot 3: Local Partnerships**\n",
       "  - **Metrics**: Delivery volume shared, operational cost savings.\n",
       "  - **Sample Size**: Validate through 20 partnerships (5 partners for each quarter).\n",
       "  - **Frequency**: Bi-monthly.\n",
       "  - **Stopping Criteria**: If no partners yield measurable benefits post 6 months, wind down efforts.\n",
       "\n",
       "**6) Non-obvious Failure Modes for Fleet Electrification:**\n",
       "1. **Technical Mode**: Battery degradation faster than expected.\n",
       "   - **Detection Signal**: Frequent maintenance needs and lower-than-expected range.\n",
       "   - **Mitigation**: Regular audits of battery performance and shifting to a maintenance schedule reflecting real-time usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Operational Mode**: Underestimating charging times leading to unavailability.\n",
       "   - **Detection Signal**: Increased downtime reported.\n",
       "   - **Mitigation**: Complement with hybrid vehicles or ensure clearly communicated charging schedules.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Social Mode**: Employee pushback on new technology.\n",
       "   - **Detection Signal**: Increased turnover or reduced job satisfaction scores.\n",
       "   - **Mitigation**: Enhance training programs alongside user feedback loops to foster acceptance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "Our proposed plan provides a robust pathway with quantifiable metrics to balance costs, emissions, and timeliness. By implementing strategic options with well-defined metrics and clear assumptions, monitoring outcomes, and identifying failure modes, the delivery company can optimize its operations effectively amidst uncertainty."

      "### Response to Urban Delivery Company’s Objectives \n",
      "\n",
      "**1) Quantitative Objective Function:**\n",
      "To effectively balance costs, emissions, and on-time deliveries, our objective function can be defined as:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Objective: Minimize Cost (C) + Emissions (E) + (1 - On-time Delivery Rate (ODR))**\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be mathematically represented as:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Minimize: C + E + (1 - ODR)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "- C = Total operational cost ($) over a 5-year horizon\n",
      "- E = Total emissions (CO2 equivalent tons) over the same period\n",
      "- ODR = On-time delivery rate (%) aimed to improve by 15% from the baseline in five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Measurable Objectives:**\n",
      "- Reduce operational costs by 20% ($X to $Y in 5 years).\n",
      "- Decrease emissions by 30% (from X tons CO2 to Y tons CO2).\n",
      "- Improve on-time delivery from X% to at least Y% over 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Strategic Options:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option 1: Fleet Electrification**\n",
      "- **Expected Benefits:** Reduction in fuel costs up to 40%; emissions cut by approximately 50%.\n",
      "- **Resource Requirements:** Investment in electric vehicles (EVs) (50 units at $60,000 each), charging infrastructure (estimated $500,000 installation).\n",
      "- **Key Risks:** Higher upfront costs and potential early-stage technology failures; dependency on local charging infrastructure.\n",
      "- **Costs:** Estimated total cost of $5 million over 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option 2: Advanced Routing Algorithms**\n",
      "- **Expected Benefits:** On-time delivery improvements by 15-25%; fuel efficiency increase by 10%.\n",
      "- **Resource Requirements:** Software purchase ($100,000), training for staff, and potential ongoing service fees (about $20,000 annually).\n",
      "- **Key Risks:** Software integration issues, reliance on real-time data accuracy; potential temporary disruptions in original workflow.\n",
      "- **Costs:** Roughly $300,000 for initial investment and 5-year operational costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option 3: Strategic Partnerships with Local Businesses**\n",
      "- **Expected Benefits:** Shared resources leading to operational cost savings of around 10%; improved density in delivery and potentially 20% boost in on-time deliveries.\n",
      "- **Resource Requirements:** Staff time for partnership development (~200 hours), marketing budget for collaboration (~$50,000).\n",
      "- **Key Risks:** Partner reliability and alignment; potential dilution of company values or service quality.\n",
      "- **Costs:** Estimated cost of $250,000 for 5 years for time and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3) Decision Rule and Threshold Values:**\n",
      "Create a decision tree based on observable market indicators (fuel costs, infrastructure availability for EVs, routing inefficiencies, partnerships) that guide a switch in strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Thresholds:**\n",
      "- If fuel costs rise by more than 10% beyond baseline, prioritize Fleet Electrification.\n",
      "- If on-time delivery drops more than 5% quarter-over-quarter, switch focus to Advanced Routing Algorithms.\n",
      "- If traffic congestion increases by 15% or more, use Strategic Partnerships for localized solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4) Assumptions and Contingencies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assumption**: Fuel prices will remain stable.\n",
      "   - **False Scenario**: Shift budget towards hybrid or less fuel-dependent vehicles.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Assumption**: Local infrastructure will support EV adoption.\n",
      "   - **False Scenario**: Implement more aggressive partnerships or retrain delivery staff for adaptability to hybrid vehicles.\n",
      "  \n",
      "3. **Assumption**: Technology adoption of routing systems will meet adaptations.\n",
      "   - **False Scenario**: Seek alternatives (manual methods, simpler software) until multiple options have been effectively tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Assumption**: Demand growth is predictable.\n",
      "   - **False Scenario**: Pivot towards developing flexible staffing models (increasing gig workforce) to handle variable demand.\n",
      "  \n",
      "5. **Assumption**: Partnerships can be reliably established with local businesses.\n",
      "   - **False Scenario**: Focus on internal capacity building to handle increased local deliveries independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5) Monitoring and Experiment Plan:**\n",
      "Conduct experimental pilots focusing on delivery times, costs, and emissions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pilot 1: Electronic Vehicle Fleet Pilot**\n",
      "  - **Metrics**: Delivery costs, emissions produced.\n",
      "  - **Sample Size**: 10% of deliveries (200 deliveries within one quarter).\n",
      "  - **Frequency**: Quarterly.\n",
      "  - **Stopping Criteria**: If emissions exceed 20% of forecast, stop the rollout.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pilot 2: Routing Software Test**\n",
      "  - **Metrics**: Average delivery time, fuel consumption.\n",
      "  - **Sample Size**: 15% of routes analyzed (150 routes over 3 months).\n",
      "  - **Frequency**: Monthly review.\n",
      "  - **Stopping Criteria**: If no improvement after 2 consecutive reporting periods, revert to prior methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pilot 3: Local Partnerships**\n",
      "  - **Metrics**: Delivery volume shared, operational cost savings.\n",
      "  - **Sample Size**: Validate through 20 partnerships (5 partners for each quarter).\n",
      "  - **Frequency**: Bi-monthly.\n",
      "  - **Stopping Criteria**: If no partners yield measurable benefits post 6 months, wind down efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6) Non-obvious Failure Modes for Fleet Electrification:**\n",
      "1. **Technical Mode**: Battery degradation faster than expected.\n",
      "   - **Detection Signal**: Frequent maintenance needs and lower-than-expected range.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Regular audits of battery performance and shifting to a maintenance schedule reflecting real-time usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operational Mode**: Underestimating charging times leading to unavailability.\n",
      "   - **Detection Signal**: Increased downtime reported.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Complement with hybrid vehicles or ensure clearly communicated charging schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Social Mode**: Employee pushback on new technology.\n",
      "   - **Detection Signal**: Increased turnover or reduced job satisfaction scores.\n",
      "   - **Mitigation**: Enhance training programs alongside user feedback loops to foster acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Our proposed plan provides a robust pathway with quantifiable metrics to balance costs, emissions, and timeliness. By implementing strategic options with well-defined metrics and clear assumptions, monitoring outcomes, and identifying failure modes, the delivery company can optimize its operations effectively amidst uncertainty.\n",

      "**Objective Function**\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective function is a weighted sum of the costs, emissions, and timeliness metrics, with the following units:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cost: $/trip (USD per delivery)\n",
      "* Emissions: kg CO2e/trip (carbon footprint in tons of CO2 equivalent)\n",
      "* Timeliness: % on-time (percentage of deliveries completed within 1.5 hours)\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective function for the next 5 years can be written as:\n",
      "\n",
      " Minimize [0.3 Cost + 0.4 Emissions + 0.3 Timeliness] / Time\n",
      "\n",
      "where Time is measured in years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategic Options**\n",
      "\n",
      "Three distinct strategic options are presented below, each with expected benefits, concrete resource requirements, key risks, and rough order-of-magnitude costs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Optimized Fleet Composition**\n",
      "Expected Benefits:\n",
      "\t* Reduced emissions by 15% (year 1)\n",
      "\t* Increased on-time deliveries by 10%\n",
      "\t* Lowered labor costs by $300,000 (year 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Concrete Resource Requirements:\n",
      "\t* Replace diesel trucks with electric vehicles (25-30 units, $1.2M - $1.8M upfront cost)\n",
      "\t* Reduce bicycle fleet by 20% (Year 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Risks: Electric vehicle charging infrastructure limitations, public perception barriers\n",
      "\n",
      "Rough Order-of-Magnitude Costs: Upfront cost of EVs: $1.5M; labor and training costs: $0.6M/year\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Smart Routing Optimizer**\n",
      "Expected Benefits:\n",
      "\t* Reduced emissions by 10% (year 1)\n",
      "\t* Increased on-time deliveries by 8%\n",
      "\t* Reduced fuel consumption by 20%\n",
      "\n",
      "Concrete Resource Requirements:\n",
      "\t* Develop and implement advanced routing optimization software ($1M - $2M upfront cost)\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Risks: Technical integration challenges, potential dependence on accurate traffic data\n",
      "\n",
      "Rough Order-of-Magnitude Costs: Software development: $1.5M; support and training costs (yearly): $0.3M/year\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hybrid Fleet and Partnership**\n",
      "Expected Benefits:\n",
      "\t* Reduced emissions by 20% (year 1)\n",
      "\t* Increased on-time deliveries by 12%\n",
      "\t* Enhanced brand reputation through partnerships with clean energy providers\n",
      "\n",
      "Concrete Resource Requirements:\n",
      "\t* Partner with a clean energy provider ($500,000 - $1M in one-time upfront costs)\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Risks: Dependence on partner performance, complex contract negotiation\n",
      "\n",
      "Rough Order-of-Magnitude Costs: Upfront contract signing fees: $0.5M; ongoing energy costs (Year 4-5): $50,000/year\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Rule**\n",
      "\n",
      "A decision tree can be used to choose among the strategies based on a set of scenario-specific metrics and time horizons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Evaluate Scenario A (Optimised Fleet Composition works well)\n",
      "2. If Optimized Fleet Composition is effective in reducing emissions and improving timeliness\n",
      "3. Switch to hybrid option when emissions are improved by at least 10% and on-time deliveries reach 95%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision Rule threshold switches:\n",
      "\t- If scenario improves, transition seamlessly; \n",
      "\t-   if not, move to a mixed fleet plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assumptions**\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimized fleet composition strategy relies on the following five assumptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Increasing demand**: Demand is expected to increase by 8% annually for the next three years.\n",
      "2. **Public perception shift**: Growing public awareness of climate change will create a cultural shift towards carbon neutrality, driving urban governments to implement congestion pricing (Year 3).\n",
      "3. **Urban development trends**: Cities are planning new green infrastructure projects and expanding transportation options that promote cycling and electric vehicles.\n",
      "4. **Energy storage advancements**: Advances in battery technology will lower the cost of purchasing EV batteries by at least $300/ton CO2e.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Monitoring and Experiment Plan**\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce uncertainty, the company should conduct experiments under controlled conditions and then scale up successful approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sampling Methodology: Random sampling using 10-day window to analyze efficiency per city pair\n",
      "   Sample size: n=16 (8 random samples * 2 control & treatment groups)\n",
      "3. Stop criterion: Reach a minimum of 15 successful deliveries among the control group when evaluating changes in on-time delivery rates.\n",
      "4. Sampling frequency: Run experiments every three months (January, April, July and October)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tests**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Test for differences between optimized routes using Google Maps' direction optimizer API or alternative routing software\n",
      "\t* Sample size: 10 random trips from control and treatment groups\n",
      "2. Perform 10-day window tests to evaluate on-time delivery rates among both sample sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Failure Modes (Technical, Operational, Social)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Three subtle failure modes for the optimized fleet composition strategy are:\n",
      "\n",
      " Failure Mode (I): Battery degradation affecting route efficiency in heavy traffic conditions\n",
      "\n",
      " Mitigation Steps: Schedule battery replacements within every six month cycle of usage; Invest $150k/year toward proactive maintenance schedules; Partner with key battery component suppliers to anticipate improvements and lower costs.\n",
      "\n",
      " Failure mode (II): Increased vehicle utilization rate affects road wear and tear\n",
      "\n",
      " Mitigation measures: Implement vehicle monitoring software for optimizing routes in heavy traffic, using data-driven insights about trip volumes & frequencies. Improve customer service with flexible routing that includes 'express' options available for the most urgent needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach can help the company meet its goals and reduce costs while also lowering emissions. The key risks need to be addressed through planning, experimentation, or partnership with key stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade-off: Reducing emissions requires significant upfront investment; however, investments can pay off by generating additional income streams via congestion pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimized fleet composition strategy prioritizes environmentally friendly transportation options and aims for increased efficiency in logistics while balancing cost-effectiveness.\n",
