My name is Benjamin Schmidt. I initially came from a ICT support background where I mostly solved problem related to Microsoft products like Office 365. Today I moved beeing a ICT Support agent to a highly motivated Blockchain and AI enthusiast.
My goal is to improve my skills in the blockchain sector with the help of AI. Because I currently have no job and are going to south africa for 3 month I currently don't really know how my working career will look in the end of this year.
I really enjoy working from home and focus on a project that goes on for a while. When I worked as a support engineer I had to face multiple issues/project in one day and wasn't able to focus and dig deeper into one issue at a time.
Working at saynode gave me the oppurtunity to dig deeper into projects and isses where I was able to unfold my potential in problem solving and developing.

My favorit movie is "the place beyond the pines with ryan gosling. My lucky number is 2. My biggest achivement was receiving my EFZ for ICT engeneering which took my 4 years.
Sadly I don't have any hobbies. I just really like to travel around with my girlfiend and and visiting cities and thier restaurants.
My current goal besides my work career is find a hobby that involves sport joy.
